[![Build Status](https://github.com/basler/pypylon/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/basler/pypylon/actions/workflows/main.yml)

# Getting Started

 * Install [pylon](https://www.baslerweb.com/pylon)
   This is strongly recommended but not mandatory. See [known issues](#known-issues) for further details.
 * Install pypylon: ```pip3 install pypylon```
   For more installation options and the supported systems please read the [Installation](#Installation) paragraph.
 * Look at [samples/pylon/grab/grab.py](https://github.com/basler/pypylon/blob/master/samples/pylon/grab/grab.py) or use the following snippet:

```python
from pypylon import pylon

# Create an InstantCamera object with the camera device found first.
# The with statement opens the camera and closes it automatically.
with pylon.InstantCamera(pylon.FirstFound) as camera:
    print("Using device:", camera.DeviceInfo.ModelName)

    # Demonstrate some feature access using the pylon parameter API.
    new_width = camera.Width.Value - camera.Width.Inc
    if new_width >= camera.Width.Min:
        camera.Width.Value = new_width

    number_of_images_to_grab = 100
    camera.StartGrabbingMax(number_of_images_to_grab)

    while camera.IsGrabbing():
        # The grab result is released automatically at the end of the with block.
        with camera.RetrieveResult(5000, pylon.TimeoutHandling_ThrowException) as grab_result:
            if grab_result.GrabSucceeded():
                # Access the image data.
                print("SizeX:", grab_result.Width)
                print("SizeY:", grab_result.Height)
                img = grab_result.Array
                print("Gray value of first pixel:", img[0, 0])
```

## Getting Started with pylon Data Processing

 * pypylon additionally supports the pylon Data Processing API extension.
 * The [pylon Workbench](https://docs.baslerweb.com/overview-of-the-workbench) allows you to create image processing designs using a graphical editor.
 * Hint: The [pylondataprocessing tests](https://github.com/basler/pypylon/blob/master/tests/pylondataprocessing) can optionally be used as a source of information about the syntax of the API.
 * Look at [samples/pylondataprocessing/barcode/barcode.py](https://github.com/basler/pypylon/blob/master/samples/pylondataprocessing/barcode/barcode.py) or use the following snippet:

```python
from pypylon import pylon
from pypylon import pylondataprocessing

# This object collects the output data. Create it before the recipe so it outlives it.
result_collector = pylondataprocessing.GenericOutputObserver()

# Create a recipe object representing a recipe file created with the pylon Viewer Workbench.
with pylondataprocessing.Recipe() as recipe:
    recipe.Load("barcode.precipe")
    recipe.RegisterAllOutputsObserver(result_collector, pylon.RegistrationMode_Append)
    recipe.Start()

    for i in range(100):
        if result_collector.WaitObject.Wait(5000):
            result = result_collector.RetrieveResult()
            # Print the barcodes.
            barcodes = result["Barcodes"]
            if not barcodes.HasError():
                for index in range(barcodes.NumArrayValues):
                    print(barcodes[index].ToString())
            else:
                print("Error:", barcodes.ErrorDescription)
        else:
            print("Result timeout")
            break
```

# Update your code to pypylon >= 26.06

The current pypylon implementation allows direct feature assignment:

```python
cam.Gain = 42
```

This assignment style is deprecated with pypylon 3.0.0, as it prevents full typing support for pypylon.

The recommended assignment style is now:

```python
cam.Gain.Value = 42
```

To identify the locations in your code that have to be updated, run with enabled warnings:

`PYTHONWARNINGS=default python script.py`

pypylon now also ships the full pylon parameter API (classes derived from
`Pylon::CParameter`). It adds many convenience methods on parameters, such as
`camera.ExposureTime.SetToMaximum()`, `camera.PixelFormat.TrySetValue("Mono8")`
and `camera.ExposureTime.GetValueOrDefault(default_value)`. In addition,
`pylon.InstantCamera` supports the context manager protocol, so it can be used
in a `with` statement to be opened and closed automatically. See the
[samples](https://github.com/basler/pypylon/tree/master/samples) and the style
guidelines in the [context](https://github.com/basler/pypylon/tree/master/context)
folder for the recommended coding style.

# Installation
## Prerequisites
 * Installed [pylon](https://www.baslerweb.com/pylon)
   For the binary installation this is not mandatory but strongly recommended. See [known issues](#known-issues) for further details.
 * Installed [python](https://www.python.org/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
 * Installed [CodeMeter Runtime](https://www.wibu.com/support/user/user-software.html) when you want to use pylon vTools and the pylon Data Processing API extension on your platform.

## pylon OS Versions and Features
Please note that the pylon Software Suite may support different operating system versions and features than pypylon.
For latest information on pylon refer to: https://www.baslerweb.com/en/software/pylon/
In addition, check the release notes of your pylon installation. 
For instance: 
* pylon Software Suite 26.06 supports Windows 10/11 64 bit, Linux x86_64 and Linux aarch64 with glibc version >= 2.31 or newer,
  macOS Sonoma or newer.
* pylon vTools are supported on pylon 7.0.0 and newer.
* pylon vTools are supported on pypylon 3.0 and newer only on Windows 10/11 64 bit, Linux x86_64 and Linux aarch64. 
* For pylon vTools that require a license refer to: https://www.baslerweb.com/en/software/pylon-vtools/
* CXP-12: To use CXP with pypylon >= 4.0.0 you need to install the CXP GenTL producer and drivers using the pylon Software Suite setup.
* For accessing Basler 3D cameras, e.g. Basler blaze, installation of pylon Software Suite 8.1.0 or newer
  and the latest pylon Supplementary Package for blaze is required.

## Binary Installation
The easiest way to get pypylon is to install a prebuild wheel.
Binary releases for most architectures are available on [pypi](https://pypi.org)**.
To install pypylon open your favourite terminal and run:

```pip3 install pypylon```

The following versions are available on pypi:

 |                | 3.9 | 3.10 | 3.11 | 3.12 | 3.13 |
 |----------------|-----|------|------|------|------|
 | Windows 64bit  | x   | x    |  x   |  x   |  x   |
 | Linux x86_64*  | x   | x    |  x   |  x   |  x   |
 | Linux aarch64* | x   | x    |  x   |  x   |  x   |
 | macOS x86_64** | x   | x    |  x   |  x   |  x   |
 | macOS arm64**  | x   | x    |  x   |  x   |  x   |


> Additional Notes on binary packages:
> * (*) The linux 64bit binaries are manylinux_2_31 conformant.
    This is roughly equivalent to a minimum glibc version >= 2.31. 
    :warning: You need at least pip 20.3 to install them.
> * (**) macOS binaries are built for macOS >= 14.0 (Sonoma)

## Installation from Source
Building the pypylon bindings is supported and tested on Windows, Linux and macOS

You need a few more things to compile pypylon:
 * An installation of pylon SDK for your platform
 * A compiler for your system (Visual Studio on Windows, gcc on linux, xCode commandline tools on macOS)
 * Python development files (e.g. `sudo apt install python-dev` on linux)
 * [swig](http://www.swig.org) 4.3
   * For all 64bit platforms you can install the tool via `pip install "swig==4.3"`

To build pypylon from source:
```console
git clone https://github.com/basler/pypylon.git
cd pypylon
pip install .
```

If pylon SDK is not installed in a default location you have to specify the location from the environment
 * on Linux: `export PYLON_ROOT=<installation directory of pylon SDK>`
 * on macOS: `export PYLON_FRAMEWORK_LOCATION=<framework base folder that contains pylon.framework>`


# Development

Pull requests to pypylon are very welcome. To help you getting started with pypylon improvements, here are some hints:

## Starting Development
```console
python setup.py develop
```
This will "link" the local pypylon source directory into your python installation. It will not package the pylon libraries and always use the installed pylon.
After changing pypylon, execute `python setup.py build` and test...

## Running Unit Tests
> NOTE: The unit tests try to import `pypylon....`, so they run against the *installed* version of pypylon.
```console
pytest tests/....
```

# Known Issues
 * For USB 3.0 cameras to work on Linux, you need to install appropriate udev rules.
   The easiest way to get them is to install the official [pylon](http://www.baslerweb.com/pylon) package.
